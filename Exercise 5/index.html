<!-- Exercise 5 -->
<!-- Create two HTML pages, "index.html" and "about.html". 
    Give a title to the "index.html" page that says "Home Page" and include a link to the about page. 
    On the about page, give it a title that says "About Page" and write some text (it can be random lorem text like above) and a link to the home page. 
    Your page does not have to look exactly like this example, as long as the links back and forth work.
